Poletch-a-Sketch
================

Description
-----------
This is a polar coordinate version of the famous etch-a-sketch, which uses rectangular coordinates.

Libraries
---------
+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
+ [KeyboardJS](http://robertwhurst.github.com/KeyboardJS/)
+ [Turtle Wax](https://github.com/davebalmer/turtlewax)

Features
--------
+ Added an interface to draw using polar coordinates with turtlewax.
+ Based on [Jonas Wagner's work](http://29a.ch/2011/9/11/uploading-from-html5-canvas-to-imgur-data-uri), implemented his approach to upload the contents of the canvas to imgur.com
+ Implemented a small way to fetch the contents of the canvas and put them as the favicon. *It takes a while to encode the contents of the canvas to base64 data, so it does it once in a while*
